TypeScripts:

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
JavScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
We can't run browser directly.
Compiler : Compile the scripts and show the error.
Interpreter : Compile the script line by line.If u get 2 line error. remaining error not showed.
Why typescript? Strongly typed languange . dstictly follow the data type.
Same javascripts code adding some features is called superset.
We can able to get error while the compile time.  



Variable declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined.
Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared.

function nestedScopeset(){
 if(true){
 //Outer
 var functionVar=1;
 let blockVar=2;
 console.log(functionVar);
 console.log(blockVar);
 }
 if(true){
  console.log(functionVar);
 console.log(blockVar);
 }
}
